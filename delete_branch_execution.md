# Branch Deletion Execution

This document records the execution of branch deletion in this repository.

## Method Used

Branches are deleted using the GitHub API by deleting their Git references:

```
DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs/heads/{branch_name}
```

## Branches Deleted

The following branches have been deleted from the repository:

- [x] consolidated - Deleted via API
- [x] consolidated-branch - Deleted via API
- [x] master - Deleted via API
- [x] temp-branch - Deleted via API

## Result

After deletion, only the `main` branch remains in the repository. All other branches have been successfully removed as requested.

## Notes

- Branch deletion via the API is permanent and cannot be undone through the GitHub UI
- The `main` branch now contains all necessary files for the project
- This cleanup helps maintain a cleaner repository structure
